# SEC EDGAR API Integration

## Overview

The HRVSTR platform integrates with the SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system to retrieve and analyze official financial filings from publicly traded companies. This integration provides access to critical insider trading data (Form 4) and institutional holdings information (Form 13F).

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

- **API Service**: Custom wrapper for SEC EDGAR API endpoints
- **Filing Parsers**: Specialized parsers for Form 4 and Form 13F documents
- **Data Extractors**: Components that extract specific data points from filing documents
- **Caching System**: Optimization layer to reduce redundant API calls

### Technical Approach

```javascript
// Sample implementation of SEC EDGAR API request
const fetchSecFiling = async (ticker, formType, count = 10) => {
  try {
    // Base URL for SEC EDGAR API
    const baseUrl = 'https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar';
    
    // Construct query parameters
    const params = new URLSearchParams({
      action: 'getcompany',
      owner: 'exclude',
      CIK: ticker,
      type: formType,      // e.g., '4' for Form 4, '13F' for Form 13F
      count: count,
      output: 'atom'
    });
    
    // Make request with appropriate headers (SEC requires user-agent)
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}?${params}`, {
      headers: {
        'User-Agent': 'HRVSTR Financial Analysis Platform'
      }
    });
    
    // Handle response
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`SEC API error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    return await response.text(); // Return XML/ATOM response
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching SEC filing:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Key Features

1. **Insider Trading Analysis**
   - Track Form 4 filings to identify insider buying/selling patterns
   - Detect cluster buying events (multiple insiders buying simultaneously)
   - Identify significant transactions based on transaction size and insider role

2. **Institutional Holdings Tracking**
   - Monitor 13F filings to track institutional investor positions
   - Analyze changes in institutional ownership over time
   - Identify stocks with increasing institutional interest

3. **Data Normalization**
   - Transform raw SEC filing data into standardized formats
   - Clean and normalize entity names, transaction types, and dates
   - Calculate derived metrics (e.g., percentage of ownership)

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: SEC Rate Limiting

The SEC imposes strict rate limits on API access.

**Solution**: Implemented a queue-based system with exponential backoff that:
- Spaces requests to stay within rate limits
- Retries failed requests with increasing delays
- Prioritizes critical data requests

### Challenge: Inconsistent Data Formats

SEC filing formats can vary between companies and over time.

**Solution**: Created robust parsers with:
- Multiple pattern matching strategies
- Fallback extraction methods
- Validation rules to ensure data quality

### Challenge: Large Document Sizes

Some SEC filings can be very large XML/HTML documents.

**Solution**: Implemented streaming parsers that:
- Process documents incrementally
- Extract only needed information
- Optimize memory usage for large filings

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Filings are cached with appropriate TTLs based on filing frequency
- **Bandwidth**: Requests are batched to minimize API calls
- **Processing**: Heavy parsing operations are moved to background workers

## Future Enhancements

1. Expand to additional SEC form types (8-K, 10-Q, 10-K)
2. Implement machine learning for automated filing analysis
3. Create alerts for significant filing events
4. Develop historical analysis tools for long-term pattern recognition
