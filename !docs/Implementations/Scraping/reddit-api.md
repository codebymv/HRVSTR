# Reddit API Integration

## Overview

The HRVSTR platform leverages the Reddit API to gather and analyze financial sentiment data from investment communities like r/wallstreetbets, r/investing, and r/stocks. This integration enables the platform to track retail investor sentiment and identify trending securities in social media discussions.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

- **Authentication Service**: OAuth 2.0 implementation for Reddit API access
- **Subreddit Scanner**: Service for collecting posts from finance-related subreddits
- **Content Analyzer**: System for extracting tickers and sentiment from text
- **Rate Limit Manager**: Component that manages API quota and prevents throttling

### Technical Approach

```javascript
// Sample implementation of Reddit API request with authentication
const fetchRedditPosts = async (subreddit, timeRange = 'week', limit = 100) => {
  try {
    // Get cached or fresh access token
    const accessToken = await getRedditAccessToken();
    
    // Base URL for Reddit API
    const baseUrl = 'https://oauth.reddit.com';
    
    // Construct endpoint and parameters
    const endpoint = `/r/${subreddit}/top`;
    const params = new URLSearchParams({
      t: timeRange,  // hour, day, week, month, year, all
      limit: limit,
      raw_json: 1
    });
    
    // Make authenticated request
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}${endpoint}?${params}`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
        'User-Agent': 'HRVSTR/1.0'
      }
    });
    
    // Handle response
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Reddit API error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.data.children.map(post => post.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching Reddit posts:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Key Features

1. **Sentiment Analysis by Ticker**
   - Analyze post and comment sentiment for specific stock tickers
   - Track sentiment changes over time (1d, 1w, 1m, 3m periods)
   - Compare social sentiment against price movement

2. **Trending Securities Detection**
   - Identify stocks with increasing mention frequency
   - Detect unusual activity spikes in specific tickers
   - Monitor emerging themes in investment communities

3. **Cross-Platform Correlation**
   - Compare Reddit sentiment with other data sources
   - Identify divergence between retail and institutional sentiment
   - Create composite sentiment scores across platforms

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: OAuth Token Management

Reddit's OAuth tokens expire frequently and need proper refresh handling.

**Solution**: Implemented a token management system that:
- Automatically refreshes tokens before expiration
- Handles token storage securely
- Provides fallback mechanisms for authentication failures

### Challenge: Filtering Relevant Content

Reddit contains significant noise and irrelevant content.

**Solution**: Created a multi-stage filtering system:
- Keyword and regex pre-filters for financial content
- Machine learning classifier for relevance scoring
- Confidence thresholds to exclude low-quality signals

### Challenge: Rate Limiting and Quota Management

Reddit imposes strict API rate limits (600 requests per 10 minutes).

**Solution**: Developed an adaptive rate limiting system:
- Distributes requests evenly across time windows
- Prioritizes high-value subreddits during quota constraints
- Implements exponential backoff for transient errors

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Posts and comments are cached based on update frequency
- **Batching**: Requests are batched to maximize efficiency within rate limits
- **Incremental Updates**: Only new content is processed after initial loads

## User Configuration

The Reddit API integration supports user configuration of:
- API credentials (client ID, client secret)
- Target subreddits for monitoring
- Update frequency and depth of analysis
- Custom ticker watchlists for focused sentiment tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. Expand to additional finance-related subreddits
2. Implement deeper comment analysis for sentiment context
3. Develop user reputation weighting for sentiment scoring
4. Create natural language processing for narrative extraction
5. Add real-time streaming capabilities for trending tickers
