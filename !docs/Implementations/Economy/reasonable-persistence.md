# Reasonable Persistence in HRVSTR's Credit Economy

## Executive Summary

HRVSTR implements a **"reasonable persistence"** model that solves a critical UX problem in freemium applications: **preventing users from being double-charged for normal navigation behavior**. This approach balances monetization goals with user trust and satisfaction.

## The Problem We Solved

### Traditional Pain Points
- **Double-Charging Anxiety**: Users afraid to refresh or navigate away after purchasing access
- **Poor Mobile Experience**: App switching or browser refreshes causing lost access
- **Trust Erosion**: Feeling "ripped off" when charged multiple times for the same content
- **Conversion Friction**: Users hesitant to purchase due to persistence concerns

### Real-World User Scenarios
```
Scenario 1: Mobile User
1. User unlocks Reddit sentiment analysis (5 credits)
2. Phone call interrupts, app goes to background
3. Returns 10 minutes later, content still accessible ✅

Scenario 2: Research Workflow
1. User unlocks market sentiment chart (8 credits) 
2. Switches to another tab to check portfolio
3. Returns to continue analysis, chart still unlocked ✅

Scenario 3: Network Issues
1. User unlocks sentiment scores (12 credits)
2. WiFi drops, page fails to load properly
3. Refreshes page, content remains accessible ✅
```

## Our "Reasonable Persistence" Approach

### Core Philosophy
> **"Users should never feel penalized for normal application usage patterns"**

We define "reasonable" based on:
- **User Intent**: Continuing the same research session vs. starting new analysis
- **Time Context**: Short interruptions vs. returning days later
- **Usage Patterns**: Normal navigation vs. system gaming
- **Value Delivery**: Ensuring users get full value from their credit investment

### Implementation Strategy

#### 1. **Tier-Based Session Windows**
Different user tiers get different persistence windows based on their subscription level:

```
Free Tier:        30 minutes  (Trial experience)
Pro Tier:         2 hours     (Single research session)
Elite Tier:       4 hours     (Extended analysis)
Institutional:    8 hours     (Full trading day)
```

**Rationale**: Higher-paying customers get more flexibility, encouraging upgrades while still protecting free users.

#### 2. **Component-Level Granularity**
Each unlocked component (chart, scores, Reddit posts) has its own session:
- Users can unlock different components at different times
- Sessions expire independently
- Granular control over spending and access

#### 3. **Transparent Communication**
Users always know:
- How long their access will last
- When sessions are about to expire
- What they've already unlocked
- Time remaining on active sessions

## Business Benefits

### 1. **Increased User Trust**
- **Predictable Experience**: Users know exactly what they're getting
- **No Surprise Charges**: Clear session durations eliminate confusion
- **Fair Value Exchange**: Users feel they get full value for credits spent

### 2. **Higher Conversion Rates**
- **Reduced Purchase Friction**: Confidence in persistence encourages spending
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Works seamlessly across devices and contexts
- **Research-Optimized**: Aligns with how users actually analyze markets

### 3. **Tier Differentiation Value**
- **Upgrade Incentive**: Longer session windows motivate tier upgrades
- **Retention Benefit**: Higher tiers feel more premium and flexible
- **Usage Pattern Alignment**: Session lengths match user sophistication levels

### 4. **Operational Efficiency**
- **Reduced Support**: Fewer "I lost access" support tickets
- **Clear Billing**: Transparent credit deductions improve billing clarity
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history for billing disputes

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Session Architecture
```
Database: research_sessions table
├── Session ID (unique identifier)
├── User ID (account linkage)
├── Component (chart/scores/reddit)
├── Credits Used (billing record)
├── Expires At (automatic cleanup)
└── Metadata (tier, costs, context)
```

### Dual Persistence Strategy
1. **Database Sessions**: Authoritative record for billing and security
2. **LocalStorage Cache**: Fast UI state management and offline resilience

### Automatic Cleanup
- Background processes expire old sessions
- Database integrity maintained automatically
- No manual intervention required

## User Experience Journey

### Before Purchase
```
User sees component with locked overlay:
"Unlock Reddit Posts for 5 credits"
├── Clear cost display
├── Feature description
└── Unlock duration hint
```

### During Session
```
User unlocks component:
├── Immediate access granted
├── Toast notification: "5 credits used"
├── Component remains unlocked
└── Session tracked in background
```

### Session Management
```
Navigation scenarios handled gracefully:
├── Page refresh → Content remains unlocked
├── Tab switching → No re-authentication needed  
├── Mobile app switching → Session persists
└── Network issues → Resilient recovery
```

### Session Expiration
```
Natural expiration flow:
├── 15-minute warning (optional notification)
├── Gradual lock-out (graceful degradation)
├── Clear re-unlock options
└── No data loss or confusion
```
