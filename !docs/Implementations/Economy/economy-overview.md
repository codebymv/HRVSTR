# HRVSTR Cross-Device Session Economy Model

## Executive Summary

HRVSTR implements an innovative **session-based freemium economy** that combines granular component pricing with sophisticated cross-device access management. Unlike traditional subscription models, our approach provides session-based component unlocking with database-backed persistence, creating a transparent, efficient, and cross-device seamless pricing experience.

## Economy Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Cross-Device Transparency**: Users see exactly what they're buying and can access it on any device
2. **Session-Based Control**: Unlock components for time-based sessions, not single uses
3. **No Double-Charging**: Active session validation prevents charging users multiple times across devices
4. **Progressive Scaling**: Start free, scale with usage and session needs
5. **Credit Efficiency**: Session-based unlocks provide better value than per-use charging

### User Experience Goals

- **Cross-Device Consistency**: Unlock on phone, continue seamlessly on desktop
- **Fair Session Billing**: Pay once for timed access across all devices

- Desktop continuation: Another 5 credits  
- Tablet review: Another 5 credits
- **Total**: 15 credits for same research

✅ **HRVSTR Session Model**: Pay once for time-based component access
- Mobile unlock: 5 credits for 2-hour session
- Desktop continuation: 0 additional credits (same session)
- Tablet review: 0 additional credits (same session)
- **Total**: 5 credits for complete cross-device research

### Cross-Device Session Benefits

- **Unlock Once, Access Everywhere**: Component unlocks work seamlessly across desktop, mobile, and tablet
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Session status updates instantly across all logged-in devices
- **No Device Limitations**: No restrictions on number of devices or switching frequency
- **Session Recovery**: Automatic restoration of active sessions when returning to HRVSTR
- **Fair Billing Protection**: Never charged twice for accessing same data across devices

## Advanced Session Management

### Database-Backed Persistence

Unlike traditional localStorage-based systems, HRVSTR implements enterprise-grade session management:

```
PostgreSQL Session Storage:
├── Cross-device accessibility
├── Real-time synchronization
├── Automatic cleanup
├── Audit trail maintenance
└── Session validation
```

### Three-Tier Access Pattern

1. **Active Session Check**: Validate existing component access across devices
2. **Cache Utilization**: Serve fresh or cached data during active sessions
3. **Credit Deduction**: Only charge when no active session exists

### Session Synchronization

- **Instant Propagation**: Session changes sync across devices in real-time
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent handling of concurrent device usage
- **Session Transfer**: Seamless handoff between devices
- **State Preservation**: Complete session state maintained across devices

## Economic Advantages

## Technical Innovation

### Cross-Device Session Architecture

```javascript
// Session validation prevents double-charging across devices
const validateActiveSession = async (userId, component) => {
  const activeSession = await db.query(`
    SELECT session_id, expires_at, credits_used
    FROM research_sessions 
    WHERE user_id = $1 AND component = $2 
      AND status = 'active' AND expires_at > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  `, [userId, component]);
  
  return activeSession.rows.length > 0 ? activeSession.rows[0] : null;
};
```
