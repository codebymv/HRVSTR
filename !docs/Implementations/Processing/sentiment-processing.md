# Sentiment Processing Implementation

## Overview

The HRVSTR platform's sentiment processing system processes financial text data from multiple sources to extract meaningful sentiment signals about securities and market conditions. This implementation combines natural language processing techniques with domain-specific financial knowledge to generate actionable sentiment insights.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

- **Text Preprocessor**: Cleans and normalizes text for analysis
- **Ticker Extractor**: Identifies stock symbols in financial discussions
- **Sentiment Classifier**: Determines sentiment polarity and strength
- **Source Weighter**: Adjusts importance based on data source reliability
- **Aggregation Engine**: Combines sentiment signals across sources and time periods

### Technical Approach

```typescript
// Sample implementation of sentiment processing pipeline
const processSentimentData = async (
  text: string, 
  source: string, 
  options?: SentimentOptions
): Promise<SentimentResult> => {
  try {
    // 1. Preprocess text for analysis
    const processedText = preprocessText(text);
    
    // 2. Extract ticker symbols
    const tickers = extractTickers(processedText);
    
    // 3. Perform sentiment analysis
    const rawSentiment = analyzeSentiment(processedText);
    
    // 4. Apply domain-specific adjustments
    const adjustedSentiment = adjustFinancialSentiment(
      rawSentiment, 
      processedText, 
      tickers
    );
    
    // 5. Apply source-specific weighting
    const weightedSentiment = applySourceWeight(
      adjustedSentiment, 
      source, 
      options?.sourceWeights
    );
    
    // 6. Format final sentiment result
    return {
      tickers,
      score: weightedSentiment.score,  // -1.0 to 1.0
      magnitude: weightedSentiment.magnitude,  // 0.0 to 1.0
      sentiment: classifySentiment(weightedSentiment.score),  // bearish, neutral, bullish
      source,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      confidence: calculateConfidence(weightedSentiment, tickers.length)
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing sentiment data:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Key Features

1. **Multi-source Sentiment Processing**
   - Processes text from diverse sources (Reddit, FinViz, news articles)
   - Applies source-specific preprocessing and weighting
   - Normalizes sentiment scores across different sources

2. **Financial Context Awareness**
   - Recognizes finance-specific terminology and context
   - Understands the significance of price movements and percentages
   - Interprets financial jargon and acronyms correctly

3. **Ticker Symbol Extraction**
   - Identifies stock symbols in various formats (cashtags, plain text)
   - Disambiguates between symbol mentions and regular words
   - Validates extracted tickers against known symbol lists

4. **Temporal Sentiment Aggregation**
   - Tracks sentiment changes over time
   - Applies time decay to older sentiment signals
   - Detects significant shifts in sentiment direction

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Noisy Social Media Text

Social media content contains slang, emojis, and non-standard language.

**Solution**: Implemented specialized preprocessing pipeline:
- Custom token normalization for financial slang
- Emoji interpretation specific to investment context
- Noise filtering with domain-specific stopwords

### Challenge: Sarcasm and Irony Detection

Financial discussions often contain sarcasm that inverts sentiment meaning.

**Solution**: Developed contextual sentiment analysis:
- Pattern recognition for common ironic expressions
- Contradiction detection between statement parts
- Community-specific language model adjustments (e.g., r/wallstreetbets dialect)

### Challenge: Domain-Specific Sentiment

General sentiment analysis performs poorly on financial text.

**Solution**: Created finance-specific enhancements:
- Custom lexicon for financial terminology
- Directional interpretation of numerical statements
- Context-aware polarity assignment for financial events

## Sentiment Processing Pipeline

1. **Text Collection**: Raw text gathered from various sources
2. **Preprocessing**: Text cleaned and normalized
   - Removal of irrelevant content (URLs, special characters)
   - Tokenization and lemmatization
   - Finance-specific stopword filtering
3. **Ticker Extraction**: Stock symbols identified and validated
4. **Base Sentiment Analysis**: Initial sentiment score calculation
   - Lexicon-based scoring
   - Machine learning classification
   - Sentence structure analysis
5. **Financial Context Adjustment**: Domain-specific refinement
   - Financial term weighting
   - Numerical context interpretation
   - Entity relationship analysis
6. **Multi-source Aggregation**: Combined sentiment determination
   - Source credibility weighting
   - Volume-based significance scaling
   - Contradictory signal resolution

## Performance Optimizations

- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of large text volumes
- **Caching**: Frequently analyzed terms and patterns cached
- **Incremental Analysis**: Only process new content after initial analysis
- **Parallel Processing**: Distribute workload across multiple threads/workers

## Data Models

The sentiment analysis system generates structured data models:

```typescript
interface SentimentData {
  ticker: string;            // Stock symbol
  score: number;             // Sentiment score (-1.0 to 1.0)
  sentiment: string;         // 'bullish', 'bearish', or 'neutral'
  source: string;            // Data source identifier
  timestamp: string;         // ISO timestamp
  postCount?: number;        // Number of posts (optional)
  commentCount?: number;     // Number of comments (optional)
}
```

## Validation and Accuracy

The sentiment analysis system is continuously validated against:
- Historical price movements following sentiment signals
- Expert analyst opinions
- Backtesting on historical data
- Ongoing accuracy monitoring

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement deep learning models for improved contextual understanding
2. Add entity relationship extraction for company/executive sentiment
3. Develop multi-language support for international markets
4. Create automated feedback loops for continuous improvement
5. Integrate audio/video sentiment analysis for earnings calls
