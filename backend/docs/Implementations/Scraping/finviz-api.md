# FinViz API Integration

## Overview

The HRVSTR platform integrates with FinViz to gather market news, analyst ratings, and technical indicators for stocks. This integration provides valuable financial sentiment data from professional sources to complement social media sentiment analysis, creating a more balanced view of market opinion.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

- **FinViz Scraper**: Service for structured data extraction from FinViz
- **HTML Parser**: Specialized parser for FinViz's specific HTML structure
- **News Aggregator**: Component that collects and categorizes financial news
- **Proxy Service**: CORS-handling proxy for browser-based requests

### Technical Approach

```javascript
// Sample implementation of FinViz data extraction via proxy
const fetchFinvizData = async (ticker) => {
  try {
    // Use proxy server to avoid CORS issues with direct scraping
    const proxyUrl = getProxyUrl();
    
    // Make request to proxy server
    const response = await fetch(`${proxyUrl}/api/finviz`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        ticker: ticker,
        dataTypes: ['news', 'ratings', 'technicals']
      })
    });
    
    // Handle response
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`FinViz proxy error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching FinViz data:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Key Features

1. **Financial News Analysis**
   - Collect recent news articles related to specific tickers
   - Extract sentiment from headlines and news content
   - Track news volume as an indicator of market interest

2. **Analyst Ratings Tracking**
   - Monitor analyst upgrades and downgrades
   - Track price target changes over time
   - Calculate consensus ratings from multiple analysts

3. **Technical Indicators**
   - Extract key technical data points (RSI, MACD, moving averages)
   - Identify technical patterns and potential signals
   - Compare technical indicators with sentiment data

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: No Official API

FinViz does not provide an official API, requiring structured HTML extraction.

**Solution**: Implemented a robust HTML parsing system:
- Uses Cheerio for server-side parsing
- Creates stable CSS selectors for key data elements
- Implements version detection to handle FinViz layout changes

### Challenge: CORS Restrictions

Browser security prevents direct scraping from client-side code.

**Solution**: Developed a dedicated proxy server that:
- Handles requests to FinViz from the backend
- Caches responses to reduce load on FinViz
- Normalizes data before returning to the client

### Challenge: Rate Limiting & IP Blocking

Excessive requests to FinViz can trigger temporary IP blocks.

**Solution**: Created an adaptive request management system:
- Implements request throttling with configurable limits
- Rotates between multiple proxy IPs when available
- Uses exponential backoff for failed requests

## Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Raw Data Collection**: HTML content is retrieved from FinViz
2. **Structured Extraction**: HTML is parsed into structured data objects
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Text content is processed for sentiment
4. **Normalization**: Data is standardized for integration with other sources
5. **Storage**: Processed data is cached with appropriate TTLs

## Integration with Other Data Sources

The FinViz integration is designed to complement other data sources:

- **Reddit Sentiment**: Professional vs. retail investor sentiment comparison
- **SEC Filings**: News sentiment correlation with insider activity
- **Price Data**: News impact on price movements

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: FinViz data is cached based on update frequency and importance
- **Selective Fetching**: Only required data components are requested
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple tickers are processed concurrently where possible

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement machine learning for improved news sentiment scoring
2. Expand data extraction to additional FinViz data points
3. Create alert system for significant news and rating changes
4. Develop historical analysis tools for long-term pattern recognition
5. Add support for screening and filtering based on FinViz criteria
